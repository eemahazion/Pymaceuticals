After much analysis, we can concur that the Capomulin drug regimen showed the best results, and we even have more data/proof to show for it, as it was tested more than other drugs. Do note that Ramicane did have outliers with smaller tumor volumes, but when we look at the data as a whole, Capomulin had more meaningful success in decreasing tumor size. What we can note from the data as well is that Infubinol data could be thrown off by outlier data that throws off the averages of tumor volume, as seen in the box plots. By getting rid of outliers, if it makes sense, we can get more normalized data. For a study of this type, it would not be wise to do so, as this is vital information with people's lives on the line. We need to be as accurate and truthful as possible. If this was data on predicting business outcomes, or forecasting of some sort for a business, it would make sense to normalize and adjust for outliers. In conclusion, Capomulin showed the most success in the trial for drugs fighting against squamous cell carcinoma.
